    <h1><i><u>TOP 10 FOOTBALLERS</u></i></h1>
    <div>
    <h3>Lionel Messi</h3>
    <p><mark>Messi winning the World Cup in Argentina in 2022 was perhaps the biggest Hollywood ending that soccer has ever seen.</mark> 
    <small>After losing the 2014 final,</small> it looked like it would never happen for Messi, who had won everything else in the game for club and country, but the crowning moment of his career finally arrived at the age of 34. He scored twice in the final as Argentina beat France on penalties, sparking an outpouring of emotion and celebrations around the globe.</p>

    <h3>Cristiano Ronaldo</h3>
    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo's story is one of a <del>supremely</del> talented athlete, but matched with a drive and will to win. His career is best summed up by one of his own quotes: "If you don't believe you are the best, then you will never achieve all that you are capable of." Ronaldo has shown that belief throughout more than two decades at the top of world soccer and often proved it to be true.</p>

    <h3>Thiery Henry</h3>
    <p><b>Thierry Henry</b> revolutionized the role of the number 9 in soccer. Tall, quick, physical, intelligent, determined, arrogant and charismatic, he represented a new generation of strikers. One of the greatest sportsmen of his generation, he won pretty much everything possible and scored unforgettable goals during his career. But his most amazing feat is undoubtedly going the whole Premier League season unbeaten with Arsenal in 2004. He was outstanding in that campaign, leading his team to an achievement never repeated since in modern English football.</p>
    <h3>Zinedine Zidane</h3>
    <p><i>Zinedine Zidane transformed soccer into a form of art.</i> <u>His elegance with the ball, his incredible technical ability</u> and his skills made him a magician. He will also be remembered forever for netting two goals in the 1998 World Cup final, of course, but probably even more for scoring the most beautiful goal in a Champions League final ever. His volley with Real Madrid against Bayer Leverkusen in 2002 was the purest you will ever see, and with his weak foot as well!</p>
    <h3>Luka Modiric</h3>
    <p><strong>"I'd like to ask you to never retire."</strong> <sub>As news conference questions go,</sub> it was unconventional, but the Italian journalist's plea -- after Modrić and Croatia were eliminated from Euro 2024 -- was met with applause, echoing the sentiment. Everybody loves Modrić. "As well as being a top player, one of the best in the world, he's even more spectacular as a person," Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said.</p>
